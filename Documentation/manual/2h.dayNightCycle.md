# Day and night cycle

The day and night cycle is managed by the class []() The script simulates the passing of time in the game with calculations to make the day last 3 hours. So every 3 hours in the real world 1 day passes in the game.

The script initializes by calling an api(worldtimeapi.org) to get the current time. Once the API call returns, the script parses the response to extract the current hour and minute, and uses that to calculate the current time in the game (from 0 to 24). This logic is only execute once at the beginning of the game to ensure the players have the same hour in all their local clients.

For the rest of the game, the time is updated every 60 seconds. Every 60 seconds we add .125 hours to the current time, in order to preserve the ration of 3hous/day.
