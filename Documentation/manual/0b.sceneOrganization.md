It's important if you are recieving the project to know how the scenes flow work and what are the main components of the scene.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lobby_Scene**        | Main game scene. Here its where the lobby and the battles exist. |
| **Bot_Scene**          | Scene for bot testing both normal and tournament bots            |
| **TournamentCreation** | Admin tool for creating new tournaments                          |

## Lobby_scene -> Main Scene

The lobby scene is the main scene of the game. In this single scene its where the whole main game happens. It's subdivided in 4 sections:

### **UI Section**

UI section for all the UI canvas, elements and functionalities of the game that aren't dynamicly spawned, like for example the playerUI. 

### **Enviroment Section**

Section for all the 3D assets and enviroment effects that the game has. Includes some small logic like the NPC dialogues or the day an night enviroment change. But most of it is just assets.
