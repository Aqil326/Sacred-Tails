  "description": "A spiritual companion from another realm, Shinsei are known to form a spirit bond with only those it deems worthy. According to one legend, The Goddess Shinsei, while watching over the world, found herself wanting to experience first-hand all of the joys she had witnessed. As the Deity thought it, it became so. Bright light erupted from her, as her spirit shattered, raining crystal shards upon the face of the planet. These crystal sprang forth into the different Shinsei we see across the land today.",
